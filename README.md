MNIST digit classification with scikit-learn, Support Vector Machine (SVM), stochastic gradient descent,Random Forest and KNN Classifier

# Mnist_Handwritten_Digit_Classification
MNIST digit classification with scikit-learn, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayse, Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifier

The goal of this project is to define a process to differentiate between a dataset of Handwritten Digits and classify them into their respective digit class. This project also demonstrates the process of classification for any dataset in a simple way especially for the beginners in the field of machine learning. 

| Classification Algorithm        | Accuracy      | precision Score  | Recall Score |
| ------------------------------- |:-------------:| ----------------:| ------------:|
| Naive Bayes                     | 0.5556        |0.676             | 0.554        |
| DecisionTree                    | 0.5558        |0.8615            | 0.8615       |
| Random Forest                   | 0.9461        |   0.9416         | 0.9414       |
| Linear SVM                      |     0.856     |    0.854         | 0.846        |


## Steps that I followed :
>Firstly I Fetch the data

>Then i applied different machine learning models:
-   SVM
-   Decision Tree
-   Random Forest
-   Naive Bayse

>Then I trained the model using the above mentioned classifiers

>I get the accuracy of 94.61% by using Random Forest Classifier.
